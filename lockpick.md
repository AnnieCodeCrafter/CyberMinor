<h2>Lockpicking</h2>

While you wouldn't normally think of lockpicking when you talk about hacking, it's still a usefull skill for a redteamer.
It's important to test physical security as well, and that includes testing which doors and locks can be opened without forcing it, and without a key. 
I've been looking around on the internet, searching for lockpicking videos and tutorials. Two videos that caught my eye was a lockpicking video from a red teamer, who gave a ted-talk about his job as a red teamer, and how lockpicking fit into his line of work. 
Another series is about a lawyer who, with his lockpicking skills, tests out which locks are secure and easy to crack and which aren't, from padlocks and bike locks to doorlocks and safes.

I've been able to do a bit of lockpicking myself. Someone from my group brought their practice lockpick set, including see-through practice padlocks.

I used a tension tool and a small lockpick to open the lock. With transparent locks, you can see what you're doing, which pins you're wiggling and which you aren't. You get visual feedback <i>with</i> the tactile feedback, which makes it easier to understand what is wrong and what is right. I managed to open these locks, and normal, closed locks, multiple times.
