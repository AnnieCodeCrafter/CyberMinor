# Company Pentest: Citrus-Andriessen
In this page I will talk about the pentest with Citrus-Andriessen. The pentest was done with two others: Joel and Thomas, who were also in my proftaak group. As a group, we decided to contact Citrus-Andriessen. They seemed like an interesting company, and even though it wasn’t my first choice from the list, it turned out to be a very interesting company to pentest with. 

## Citrus-Andriessen
Citrus-Andriessen is a company that delivers software to create and manage exams. Depending on your level of access and your role in the exam, the dashboard will have different functionality. For example, if your job is to grade the exams, you can view which exams still need grading and grade them. If your job is to create the exams, you can create them, set the location and time where the exam will be held, and appoint people to grade exams. 

## Process
We were given a couple of domains to pentest. It was blackbox, so we didn’t know what could be found. There wasn’t really a scope, so as a group, we decided we’d try to go as in-depth as possible. We divided the work and did some tests, while making sure to save any screenshots. The documentation was made afterwards. 
After handing in that first version, we got some feedback from the company that we incorporated into the document over Christmas break. It did involve some extra testing, which we also took screenshots from and made sure to incorporate it. 

## Reflection
Within the group, communication was very good and smooth. Communication with the company went a little slower, but that was to be expected with Covid; it was still very good and we had plenty of time to test. We were a bit later with some of the documentation. 

I think the biggest flaw was that we started pentesting without much of a plan. We had the cyber kill chain – reconnaissance, intrustion, exploitation, etc – but in the end we weren’t sure what tests we were gonna do once we were past ‘reconnaisance’, so we just did some that we deemed important, like checking for injection flaws, uncaught upload files, etcetera. 

The company later gave us some feedback, that we should structure it to the OWASP top 10 instead, which was interesting to me because it did give some more certainty what we should test. Even if the tests were clean, we could definitely say that we tested on these areas and they were, in fact, clean. 
All in all it was a very fun experience. I learned a lot from this pentest, and would love to do more in the future.
