# Proftaak - Intersect
## Making IoT Guidelines

For the proftaak, our goal was to make guidelines to help developers make their IoT devices as secure as possible. We did research into several cases - smartboards, smart watches, and other Iot. We based the guidelines off of the points we found in these cases, as well as other, existing guidelines. We posted our guidelines online to make sure they are accessible to the public for free, so that it may reach as wide an audience as possible. 

## Process
We started off with some research. We had gotten two cases that we could use - the smartboard and airscrubber. We pentested both of these and documented these findings. Then, we started looking into creating the guidelines. We researched how best to set these guidelines up. This went through many iterations, until with teacher feedback, we had landed on the format that we are using now. Meanwhile we also did research into an IoT device on our own, which would become the smartwatch research. We picked out several smartwatches from the ISSD and pentested these. These cases were also incorporated into the guidelines. 

## Involvement
Personally, I helped a bit with the airscrubber, I helped pentest the watches, and I wrote many of the guidelines on the site. I also helped with much of the documentation surrounding these projects. I wrote, gave feedback, and processed feedback. 

## Retrospective
Looking back, it was very interesting and fun to do. Working together went well, communication was great and our team leader did his job well. Communication with the company and teachers is also very good. My teammates gave me feedback as well - that I did my job well and work with them well, but that I am a bit quiet in the meetings online. This did improve over time, however.
